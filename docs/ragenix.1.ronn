ragenix(1) -- age-encrypted secrets for Nix
===========================================

## SYNOPSIS

`ragenix` [`--rules` <PATH>=./secrets.nix] [`-i` <PATH>]... (`-e` <PATH> | `-r`)<br>
`ragenix` `-e` <PATH><br>
`ragenix` `-r`<br>

## DESCRIPTION

`ragenix` encrypts secrets defined in a Nix configuration expression using
`age(1)`. It is safe to publicly expose the resulting age-encrypted files, e.g.,
by checking them into version control or copying them to the world-readable Nix
store.

## OPTIONS

* `-e`, `--edit` <PATH>:
    Decrypt the file at <PATH> and open it for editing. If the <PATH> does not
    exist yet, `ragenix` opens an empty file for editing. In any case, the
    given <PATH> has to match a rule as configured in the file given to the
    `--rules` option. After editing, `ragenix` encrypts the updated contents
    and replaces the original file.

    If the `--identity` option is not given, `ragenix` tries to decrypt <PATH>
    with the default SSH private keys. See `--identity` for details.

    The encrypted file always uses an ASCII-armored format.

    `ragenix` writes the decrypted plaintext contents of the secret at <PATH>
    to a temporary file which is only accessible by the calling user. After
    editing, `ragenix` deletes the file, making it inaccessible after `ragenix`
    exits.

* `--editor` <PROGRAM>:
    Use the given <PROGRAM> to open the decrypted file for editing. Defaults to
    the `EDITOR` environment variable.

    <PROGRAM> may denote an absolute binary path or a binary relative to the
    `PATH` environment variable. `ragenix` assumes <PROGRAM> accepts the
    absolute path to the decrypted age secret file as its first argument.

    Giving the special token `-` as a <PROGRAM> causes `ragenix` to read from
    standard input. In this case, `ragenix` stream-encrypts data from standard
    input only and does not open the file for editing.

* `-r`, `--rekey`:
    Decrypt all secrets given in the rules configuration file and encrypt them
    with the defined public keys. If a secret file does not exist yet, it is
    ignored. This option is useful to grant a new recipient access to one or
    multiple secrets.

    If the `--identity` option is not given, `ragenix` tries to decrypt <PATH>
    with the default SSH private keys. See `--identity` for details.

    When rekeying, `ragenix` does not write any plaintext data to disk; all
    processing happens in-memory.

* `-R`, `--rekey-one` <PATH>:
    Decrypt specified secrets given in the rules configuration file and encrypt
    them with the defined public keys. This option is useful to grant a new
    recipient access to specific secrets.

    If the `--identity` option is not given, `ragenix` tries to decrypt <PATH>
    with the default SSH private keys. See `--identity` for details.

    When rekeying, `ragenix` does not write any plaintext data to disk; all
    processing happens in-memory.

## COMMON OPTIONS

* `--rules` <PATH>:
    Path to a file containing a Nix expression which maps age-encrypted secret
    files to the public keys of recipients who should be able to decrypt them.
    Each defined secret file string is considered relative to the parent
    directory of the rules file. See the [EXAMPLES][] section for a
    simple rules configuration.

    If omitted, `ragenix` reads the content of the `RULES` environment
    variable. If the environment variable is also unset, `ragenix` tries
    opening the file `secrets.nix` in the current working directory.

* `-i`, `--identity` <PATH>:
    Decrypt using the identities at <PATH>.

    This option can be repeated. Additionally, `ragenix` uses the default
    Ed25519 and RSA SSH authentication identities at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa, respectively. Identities given explicitly take precedence
    over the default SSH identities. If no identities are given, `ragenix`
    tries using the default SSH identities only.

    Passphrase-encrypted age identities and passphrase-encryted SSH identities
    are supported. Currently, however, it is necessary to enter the passphrase
    of an SSH identity for each file to decrypt. This may result in poor
    usability, particularly when using the `--rekey` option.

    For further details regarding this option also refer to `age(1)`.

## FURTHER OPTIONS

* `-s`, `--schema`:
    Print the JSON schema the Nix configuration rules have to conform to and
    exit. Useful for consumption by third-party applications.

* `-v`, `--verbose`:
    Print additional information during program execution.

* `-V`, `--version`:
    Print the version and exit.

## PLUGINS

`ragenix` also supports `age` plugins. If the plugin binaries are present in
`PATH`, `ragenix` picks them up as needed.

Additionally, `ragenix` supports adding plugins to its derviation to make them
always available to `ragenix`. Use the `plugins` argument of the derivation to
wrap the `ragenix` binary with a `PATH` extended by the given plugin
derivations. Matching plugin binaries which are part of `PATH` when invoking
`ragenix` are preferred. See the [EXAMPLES][] section for an example.

## EXAMPLES

A basic Nix configuration rules file (typically named secrets.nix) which
defines a secret file secret.txt.age which should be encrypted to an age and
an SSH recipient. `ragenix` looks for secret.txt.age relative to ./secrets/:

    $ cat ./secrets/secrets.nix
    {
      "secret.txt.age".publicKeys = [
        "age1g4eapz2lkdvrevsg443yx8rhxklhyz4sa8w0jdfyh8sgx3azhftsz8zu07"
        "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKrb9ne3nZjw6DW[...]8h/Zoa"
      ];
    }
    $ file ./secrets/secret.txt.age
    ./secrets/secret.txt.age: ASCII text

Edit the secret file secret.txt.age in the default editor while using the
default SSH Ed25519 identity at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 with a rules configuration
file different from ./secrets.nix:

    $ ls ~/.ssh/
    id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
    $ ls /var/lib/secrets/
    rules.nix secret.txt.age
    $ ragenix --rules /var/lib/secrets/rules.nix -e secret.txt.age

Rekey all secrets given in ./secrets.nix with the age identity
~/.age/ragenix.key:

    $ ragenix -i ~/.age/ragenix.key -r

Create/edit a secret from the system clipboard (on macOS):

    $ pbpaste | ragenix --editor - -e secret.txt.age

Use `--editor` to generate an SSH Ed25519 private key:

    $ ragenix --editor 'ssh-keygen -q -N "" -t ed25519 -f' -e ssh_host_key.age

Make the `age` YubiKey plugin available to `ragenix`:

    $ cat myragenix.nix
    { ragenix, age-plugin-yubikey }:
    ragenix.override { plugins = [ age-plugin-yubikey ]; }
